## Purpose
This is a long term project to consolidate information found in different modules into a single module to minimize which modules I need to load when running my homebrew campaign (that utilizes some published content). The first part of the project was to map artwork from my purchased adventures into the PF2E actor compendia (those in addition to the Bestiary Token Pack provided by Paizo). Future goals and updates are to include:
- Compendium for all Dimetria NPCs
- Compendium for all Dimetria Special Items and Artifacts
- Incorporating modification of the PF2E Staves Module to automate adding spells from Artifact to Character Sheets.
- Compendium for World, Region, City, and Adventure Maps

## Authorized Use
This is for my personal use as I have purchased the parent modules containing the artwork that is mapped for the following adventures:
- Abomination Vaults
- Beginners Box
- Pathfinder Society Year 4 - Year of Boundless Wonders
- Outlaws of Alenstar
-- AP178 Punks in a Powderkeg
-- AP179 Cradle of Quartz
-- AP180 The Smoking Gun
- The Blood Lords
-- AP181 Zombie Feast
